A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Inspiration
Did you know? [4 chords can play most songs!](https://www.musical-u.com/learn/four-chords-and-the-truth/)
This year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry was for a method developed for genome editing. While I was exploring genetics, I realised that the DNA strands are made of 2 pairs of nucleotides - (Adenine, Thymine) and (Cytosine, Guanine). Given that they can occur in 4 variations, we can correlate each set to a chord, and these produce music. Since everyone's DNA is unique, it ensures everyone's music is also unique!

## What it does
* You can produce unique music which is coded to your genes.
* You can share this audio with friends.
* Additionally, you can learn playing a music instrument of your choice on our platform.
* You can visualise any existing 4 chord music as a DNA sequence.

## How I built it
I built it using Flutter and dart. I first did my research and understood the basics of genetics, genes, DNA and ATCG building blocks. Then I did basic pen-paper wireframing, post which I made a User Experience flow in Adobe XD. Then I made a Flutter project in Android Studio. For most issues faced I used stackoverflow.
Then while coding, I explored the need for various plugins and decided to define a tasklist for myself. Source for the terms is [DNA Flashcards](https://quizlet.com/4348465/dna-flashcards/).

### Tasklist identified

- [ ] Youtube API for playing videos directly from Youtube
- [x] Lottie for Animated gifs
- [x] Onboarding screen plugin
- [x] Dialog box for audio/video download confirmation
- [x] Splash screen plugin
- [ ] Music Player playing real audio files
- [x] Share plugin for sharing audio to social media (Used but an issue)
- [x] Expansion tile cards for flash cards to show terms and meanings
- [ ] Dynamically changing the DNA sequence image and audio based on user string input
- [ ] Using firebase to store and validate email and password after sign up and log in

## Challenges I ran into
Working alone meant I needed to brainstorm all ideas myself, do the design as well as the video, the coding for the app by myself. This meant I couldn't finish all the tasks I had envisioned to complete this weekend.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This was only my second time using Flutter, so I was determined to learn more about Flutter's additional capabilities. I explored the plugins for making splash screen and the onboarding screens. I used an API successfully for the first time to watch embedded videos in the app directly from Youtube. Glad to have a well designed working App within the timeline.

## What I learned
[Flutter is among the fastest growing skills for software engineers](https://www.xda-developers.com/flutter-android-design-angular-material-fastest-growing-skills-software-engineers/) and I'm super pumped to be on this wagon.
* Learnt time management and making checklists to keep track of work.
* Explored the different widgets available in Flutter.

## What's next for music GENiE
* I believe it will be possible to compare similarity of songs based on whether they generate the same DNA sequence.
* I want to add games and dance videos around the theme of genetics.
* Code for dynamic image and let the user play around.
* Finish all the pending tasks from the tasklist.
* Deploy a beta version to the Google Playstore to get user reviews and work on suggestions.
